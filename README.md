# WORK IN PROGRESS

*Run at your own risk!*

*This readme should be updated later :-P*

To get the death and research notifications to Discord, you will have to modify control.lua of the save file you would like to use. It should keep the "vanilla" achievements in a working condition (not tested yet). It is slightly modified version of mlogger 0.2.

# Running
*Make sure you have your .env file in the same directory as the executable/binary, you can use .envexample the template*

There are two ways of starting FactoCord

1. Using the start.sh bash script (bash start.sh or ./start.sh) (make sure you chmod +x the script first)
2. Manually running the binary (./FactoCord)

# Installing as a service

To install FactoCord as a service so that it can run on startup, you can use the provided service.sh

*Note you must run service.sh as root/sudo to install it as a service*

Example of running service.sh:
`./service.sh factorio /home/facotrio/factocord/`


# Compiling

`Requires go 1.8 or above`

FactoCord uses the following packages:

- [DiscordGo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
- [godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv/)
- [tails](https://github.com/hpcloud/tail)

You will need to add these lib as go get:

- `go get github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo`
- `go get github.com/joho/godotenv`
- `go get github.com/hpcloud/tail/...`

To compile just do `go build`


# Error reporting

When FactoCord encounters an error will log to error.log within the same directory as itself.

If you are having an issue make sure to check the error.log to see what the problem is.

If you are unable to solve the issue yourself, please post an issue containing the error.log and I will review and attempt to solve what the problem is.


# Windows Support?

Currently I haven't had any luck getting FactoCord to run correctly on Windows, [see this](https://github.com/FactoKit/FactoCord/issues/3) for information

If a way is found to fix this problem, then Windows support will be added.
